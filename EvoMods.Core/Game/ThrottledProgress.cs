/// a 650-file package and fatal for a 119,443-file one: <see cref="Progress{T}"/> posts every report
/// to the UI thread, so the message pump backs up, the window stops responding, and **Cancel stops
/// working** — the one control that matters during a long operation. A 650-file test showed none of
/// it.
///
/// Throttling lives here rather than in each consumer so the callback rate is bounded for all of
/// them. <see cref="ReportFinal"/> always gets through, so a run never ends showing 99 %.
